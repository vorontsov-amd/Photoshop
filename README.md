## Photoshop

Photoshop is an unfinished project in development, aimed at creating a software application with image processing capabilities similar to those of Adobe Photoshop. This project is a continuation of the RayTracing project (https://github.com/vorontsov-amd/RayTracing), which was focused on ray tracing to generate realistic images.

The Photoshop project is currently only in the concept stage and is being developed as a separate application. The goal of this project is to provide users with advanced image editing capabilities such as color correction, retouching, image manipulation, and other features that are commonly found in commercial image editing software.

Currently, there is no finished GUI for this project, and it is being developed using C++ and SFML and Qt libraries. The ultimate aim of this project is to create a fully-featured image editing software that can be used by professionals in the field.
